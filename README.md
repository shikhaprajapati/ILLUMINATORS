SMART INDIA HACKATHON - (RK60)interactive map application for real time crime reporting.

Solution Prototype

-The Real Time Crime Reporting App is an interactive user-friendly Android Application which allows users to register themselves on the app using AdhaarID, and thereafter report crimes  at real time to the police either manually through a form or by an emergency trigger action if  cannot report manually. It has a speech recognition feature which invokes SOS emergency on listening to a particular code word(user-specific) spoken by the user in emergency situations.People can also submit audio,video and image proofs along with the form.
-When a new crime is reported, the crime details along with geolocation and a list of nearby users at that instant is sent to :
	-Nearest Police station of the respective area.
	-Police control room of the respective region.
-After police introspection and confirmation, the control room uploads the crime on the app after which it becomes visible on an interactive map interface,which shows prick points/icons for each crime spot in different colours(to represent level of severness) on map. Being accessible to all it will help people and police quickly see crimes happening around them. Hovering on a prick point shows crime details.
-Other features offered by the map interface:-
	-People can share their live location on map with their guardians.
	-They can check the safest path to their destination.
	-People can  also check safety of an area on a safety meter based on past crime records.
-People will also be able to see official proceedings and  case updates of the crimes they reported.
-People may receive alerts regarding nearby crimes if necessary and may also submit witness responses against reported crimes.
